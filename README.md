# Linear-Regression---Weather-Dataset

Problem definition.
The problem that we are going to implement is,

Use case: Is there a relationship between humidity and temperature? What about between humidity and apparent temperature? Can you predict the apparent temperature given the humidity?

Before implement a machine learning model, there is an a complete idea about the problem domain that you are going to implement the solution.

Here discuss about the humidity, temperature, and apparent temperature. So we need to the clear knowladge about these terms.

In simple, Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air.

Apparent Temperature: The perceived temperature in degrees Fahrenheit derived from either a combination of temperature and wind (Wind Chill) or temperature and humidity (Heat Index) for the indicated hour. source(https://meteor.geol.iastate.edu/~ckarsten/bufkit/apparent_temperature.html)
